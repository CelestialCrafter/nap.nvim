==============================================================================
1. nap.nvim (next and previous)             *nap-nap.nvim-(next-and-previous)*

Quickly jump between next and previous NeoVim buffer, tab, file, quickfix,
diagnostic, etc.

A lightweight plugin inspired by unimpaired.vim
<https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired>, but: * Focus on navigation, not
editing or option toggling. * Jump back and forth easily with a single key,
instead of two keys. * Written in Lua.

TLDR                                                                *nap-tldr*

`<Enter>` to jump to next, `<Tab>` to jump to previous (similar to leap
<https://github.com/ggandor/leap.nvim>).

Using `b` (buffer) as an example:


- `<Enter>b` jump to next buffer, `<Tab>b` jump to previous buffer. Then just pressing
    `<Enter><Enter><Enter><Tab><Tab>...` to cycle through buffers.
- `<Enter>B` and `<Tab>B` jump to last/first buffer.


INSTALL                                                          *nap-install*

Add `liangxianzhe/nap-nvim` to your plugin manager. Then add
`require("nap").setup()`. See |nap-config| if you want to customize the prefix
keys.

OPERATORS                                                      *nap-operators*

│Operator │ Description │
│a, A     │Tab          │
│b, B     │Buffer       │
│d        │Diagnostic   │
│l, L, C-l│Location list│
│q, Q, C-q│Quickfix     │
│s        │Spell        │
│t, T, C-t│Tag          │


I plan to add File operator, similar to unimpaired. Feel free to suggest
others.

ADD NEW OPERATOR                                        *nap-add-new-operator*

You can add/override operators or easily. For example: * With Gitsigns
<https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim>, `require("nap").nap('h',
"GitSigns next_hunk", "GitSigns prev_hunk", "Next diff", "Previous diff")` *
With Aerial <https://github.com/stevearc/aerial.nvim>, `require("nap").nap("o",
"AerialNext", "AerialPrev", "Next outline symbol", "Previous outline symbol")`

CONFIG                                                            *nap-config*

The default config defines the keys:

>
    require("nap").setup({
        next_prefix = "<cr>"
        prev_prefix = "<tab>"
        next_repeat = "<cr>"
        prev_repeat = "<tab>"
    })
<


We need two pairs of keys: `prefix` keys to trigger the first jump, and
`repeat` keys to repeat with a single press. `<Enter>` and `<Tab>` are choosing
as defaults because most people don’t map them.

However, setting "prefix" and "repeat" to the same key has one issue. When
pressing `<Enter>` to repeat jump, vim will need to wait |timeoutlen| to
determine whether its is `<Enter>` or `<Enter>b`.

To make it smoother, I use `<Space>` and `C-<Space>` as the prefix keys, so
that `<Enter>` and `<Tab>` dedicated for repeating purpose.

You can find keys works for your setup, for example: * `Enter` `Tab` * `Space`
`C-Space`, * `;` `,` (using Leap or similar plugins to free these two keys)
