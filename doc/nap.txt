1. nap.nvim (next and previous)             *nap-nap.nvim-(next-and-previous)*

Quickly jump between next and previous NeoVim buffer, tab, file, quickfix,
diagnostic, etc.

A lightweight plugin inspired by unimpaired.vim
<https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired>, but:


- Focus on navigation, not editing or option toggling.
- Jump back and forth easily with a single key, instead of two keys.
- Written in Lua.


TLDR                                   *nap-nap.nvim-(next-and-previous)-tldr*

Use `b` (buffer) as an example:


- `<c-n>b`/`<c-p>b` jump to next/previous buffer. Then just pressing
    `<c-n><c-n><c-n><c-p><c-p>...` to cycle through buffers.
- `<c-n>B`/`<c-p>B` jump to last/first buffer.


OPERATORS                         *nap-nap.nvim-(next-and-previous)-operators*

  Operator    Description
  ----------- ---------------
  a, A        Tab
  b, B        Buffer
  d           Diagnostic
  l, L, C-l   Location list
  q, Q, C-q   Quickfix
  s           Spell
  t, T, C-t   Tag
  z           Fold
The following are not yet supported, feel free to suggest others: - [ ] Add
File operator, similar to unimpaired. - [ ] Support count.


ADD NEW OPERATOR           *nap-nap.nvim-(next-and-previous)-add-new-operator*

You can add/override operators or easily. For example:


- With Gitsigns <https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim>, `require("nap").nap('c', "Gitsigns next_hunk", "Gitsigns prev_hunk", "Next diff", "Previous diff")`
- With Aerial <https://github.com/stevearc/aerial.nvim>, `require("nap").nap("o", "AerialNext", "AerialPrev", "Next outline symbol", "Previous outline symbol")`


INSTALL AND CONFIG       *nap-nap.nvim-(next-and-previous)-install-and-config*

Add `liangxianzhe/nap-nvim` to your plugin manager.

Add `require("nap").setup()` to use default keys. Or change these default keys:

>
    require("nap").setup({
        next_prefix = "<c-n>",
        prev_prefix = "<c-p>",
        next_repeat = "<c-n>",
        prev_repeat = "<c-p>",
    })
<

We need two pairs of keys: `prefix` keys to trigger the first jump, and
`repeat` keys to repeat with a single press. `<c-n>` and `<c-p>` are chosen as
defaults because most people don’t map them.

However, setting `prefix` and `repeat` to the same key has one issue. When
pressing `<c-n>` to repeat jump, vim will need to wait |timeoutlen| to
determine whether its is `<c-n>` or `<c-n>b`.

Personally I use the following setup so I can cycle through using `<Enter>`
`<C-Enter>` much faster.

>
    require("nap").setup({
        next_prefix = "<space>", -- I use ; as leader so space is free
        prev_prefix = "<c-space>", -- Used much less 
        next_repeat = "<cr>", -- Enter is easy to press
        prev_repeat = "<c-cr>", -- C-Enter is easy too
    })
<

The best config for you depends on your leader key and your terminal. Here are
a few examples, feel free to try it out:


- `<C-n>` and `<C-p>`
- `<Enter>` and `<C-Enter>` (Some terminal doesn’t support `C-Enter`)
- `<Enter>` and `\` (If you remap leader key, the original leader key is near Enter)
- `<Space>` and `<C-Space>`
- `;` and `,` (use Leap/Flit or similar plugins to free these two keys)
- `]` and `[` (":help ]" to check default mappings)
- `>` and `<` (":help >" to check default mappings)
- Some `Alt` prefixed keys (Need terminal supports)
